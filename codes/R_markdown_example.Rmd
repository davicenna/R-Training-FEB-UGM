## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r chunk1}
summary(mtcars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r chunk2}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue") + # 1: scatter plot
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red") + # 2: regression line
  labs(title = "MPG vs Weight", x = "Weight", y = "Miles per Gallon") # 3: labels
```

After generating a scatterplot and a fitted line between the weight of cars and miles per gallon. There seems to be a negative relationship between the two variables of interest.

## Mathematical Equations

You can also write mathematical equations in R markdown. Equations must be written in Latex format. Example:

$$ y_{it} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} x_{it} + u_{it} $$

## Cross referencing codes

```{r chunk1_repeat, ref.label= "chunk1"}

```
